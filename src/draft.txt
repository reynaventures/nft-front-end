The license in this sub-section (2) does not include a right to create derivative works of the Azuki NFT Art except as necessary to adapt and depict the Azuki NFT Art in or on the goods or media created pursuant to this license, or as otherwise required in the “No Rights to Trademarks” Section below. But this license does permit you to mint and create new NFTs and NFT projects based on your Azuki NFT Art for Azuki NFTs that you own, as long as you don't use the Azuki Trademarks on, or to promote, such new NFTs. From time to time, we may collaborate with third parties to create Azuki NFTs which include artwork, images, works of authorship, logos, trademarks, service marks, or trade dress owned by a third party (“Third Party Content”). The license in this paragraph does not extend to any Azuki NFT or Azuki NFT Art that contains Third Party Content, and you may not use, copy, reproduce, display, create derivative works of, or create new NFTs based on such Third Party Content, or any portion thereof, for any Commercial Use, unless we or the applicable third parties expressly provide our consent in writing or by public announcement.</div>
                                <div className="lincese__block-name">Which means, you can use your Azuki NFT for Commercial Use. Yes, you can even sell the derivatives, just as long as you don't use the Azuki Trademarks. The only exception is if an Azuki NFT is a product of a collab that contains content not owned by us, then you can't use that specific Azuki NFT for Commercial Use unless we or our partner explicitly provide our consent in writing or through a public announcement. For example, we have reserved the Final 50 Beanz for future collabs to make them even more dope. If you become the owner of one of these collab'd Final 50 Beanz, you cannot use them for Commercial Use unless we or our applicable partner expressly provide our consent in writing.</div>
